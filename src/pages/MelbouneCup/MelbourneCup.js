        <strong>The Melbourne Cup</strong> is the most well-known yearly
        Thoroughbred horse race in Australia.
        <strong> This famous race</strong>, is held as part of the weeklong
        Melbourne Cup Carnival of festivities and fashion, is organised by the
        Victoria Racing Club at the Flemington Racecourse in Melbourne,
        Victoria. It is one of the most prestigious turf races as well as the
        richest "two-mile" handicap in the world. Locals refer to the event as{" "}
        <strong>"The Race that Stops the Nation"</strong> and it begins on the
        first Tuesday in November.
        <br />
        <br />
        Every year, <strong>"Cup Day"</strong> as it is fondly called by
        Aussies, draws countless numbers of spectators to Flemington{" "}
        <strong>Race Course</strong>, Melbourne, for the biggest horse racing
        event in Australia. 650 million people worldwide watch the live
        broadcast of the 3,200-meter turf event on television.

        Considering that horse racing was frequently the only legal form of
        gambling during the 19th and 20th centuries and was a popular national
        sport. Everyone, including followers of other sports besides racing,
        enjoys The Melbourne Cup.
        <br />
        <br />
        Over the years, some great horses have won the Melbourne Cup. Horses
        like Phar Lap and Makybe Diva are just a couple of the iconic runners
        symbolic of this historical race.
        <br />
        <br />
        The caliber of the Melbourne Cup jockeys is as big as the caliber of the
        horses that make up the Melbourne Cup field, given the size of the prize
        fund at risk and the national attention on the big event. Glen Boss and
        Bobbie Lewis are two Melbourne Cup jockeys who have achieved fame equal
        to that of the horses they rode to victory on "Cup Day."
        <br />
        <br />
        Victoria Derby Day, Oaks Day, and Stakes Day are three additional
        significant race days that fall under the famed Melbourne Cup Day
        umbrella. There is no other week that celebrates horse racing as
        thoroughly as Melbourne does, which falls on the first week of every
        November, and resulted in giving this Carnival a special place in the
        world of racing.
        <br />
        <br />
        Let’s not forget what makes this event so exciting. A few traditions are
        associated with the Melbourne Cup, some of which include fancy dressing
        at selected race carnivals, the serving of champagne, wine, and fine
        finger foods, and not to forget to mention that the most popular thing
        to do on this day as well, is to place a bet; even those who don't
        ordinarily gamble do so on this special occasion because after all, the
        Melbourne Cup only comes along once a year!

          <u>The Cup's Beginnings</u>
        </strong>
      </h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        Since the early years of European colonisation of the continent,
        horseracing has played a significant and widespread role in Australian
        sporting culture.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Gold Rush city of Melbourne decided to hold horse races in 1840
        where spectators could watch from a hill. Before there was a true
        grandstand, which wasn't until 1848, the organisers had built some
        scaffolding for the spectators.
        <br />
        <br />
        The region was given the name "Flemington" by the owner after a piece of
        property his Scottish-born wife owned, and by the 1850s, everyone was
        referring to the track as the "Flemington Racecourse." It is Australia's
        oldest and most famous racetrack today!
        <br />
        <br />
        An important component of Australia's national identity in the 19th
        century was the integration of horses and horsemanship. The Melbourne
        Cup was born out of Victoria's "horse culture" and the state's explosive
        economic and population boom.
        <br />
        <br />
        Numerous racing clubs had been established by the middle of the 19th
        century, and regulations had been established to organise the activity.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Victorian Turf Club founded in 1852, and the Victorian Jockey Club
        founded in 1857, were the two governing bodies of horse racing in
        Victoria when the Melbourne Cup was first held in 1861. The Turf Club
        created the Melbourne Cup to outdo the popularity of Jockey Club events
        like the Two Thousand Guineas.
        <br />
        <br />
        In 1864, the two rival organisations combined to become the Victoria
        Racing Club, which has since governed racing in Victoria, including the
        Melbourne Cup.
        <br />
        <br />
        Nowadays, one of the few significant handicap horse races in the world
        is the Melbourne Cup. A race that is handicapped assigns each horse a
        certain weight based on its age and past performance. This makes it
        difficult for gamblers to predict which horse will beat its handicap.

        <strong>
          <u>Early History</u>
        </strong>
      </h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        Frederick Standish, the chairman of the Victorian Racing Club, is
        credited with coming up with the concept for a horse race in Victoria
        and giving it the name "Melbourne Cup." Originally from England and a
        son of a Lord, Standish arrived on Australian shores in 1952. Appointed
        as an Assistant Commissioner in 1954, he resigned as Chief Commissioner
        in 1880. Standish, who served as the Victoria Racing Club's chairman
        from 1881 to 1883, was renowned for his passion of horses and horse
        racing and today is the man behind “The Race that Stops the Nation”.
        <br />
        <br />
        On Thursday, November 7, 1861, his dream came true when 17 horses
        competed in the first Melbourne Cup in front of 4,000 spectators. The
        passing of explorers Burke and Wills a few days before the race meant
        that attendance was lower than anticipated.
        <br />
        <br />
        Victorian horse ‘Mormon’ was the favourite to win the race, but instead,
        a thoroughbred native of New South Wales by the name of ‘Archer’,
        finished first, and did so in 3 minutes and 52 seconds, which remains
        the slowest time on record. It was said that in some place on the track,
        the grass was 3 meters long, which was definitely challenging for the
        horses on the day. On the day, Archer was rode by John Cutts, trained by
        Etienne de Mestre, and won the race, but that year there was no cup
        presented to the winners and the first prize consisted of 710 gold
        sovereigns and a gold watch. It was the race that ignited the
        long-running competitiveness between Victoria and New South Wales.
        <br />
        <br />
        The prize climbed to 810 gold sovereigns the next year, and attendance
        doubled to 7,000 people. With a time of 3 minutes and 47 seconds, Archer
        successfully retained his title, and Mormon once more took second place.
        A late message prevented Archer from competing in the Cup the following
        year, despite his intention to do so. This pro1mpted trainers from
        across Melbourne to boycott the event, and as a result, their horses
        were scratched from the 1863 competition. The Melbourne Cup had seven
        starters that year, the fewest ever in racing history.
        <br />
        <br />
        The first trophy was given out in 1865. It is said that Mr. Marshall,
        the winning horse's owner, called the English-made trophy a monstrosity.
        Marshall sold it to the Flemington Hunt Club right away, and it was
        renamed as the prize for the club's annual cup. Consequently, this
        trophy is officially identified as the Flemington Hunt Club Cup given to
        the champion, Babbler, in 1873. Wine retailer Wolf Blass now owns the
        trophy that Christies sold in the 1970s.
        <br />
        <br />
        The earliest Melbourne Cup that is still in its pristine condition is
        from 1866 and was created by Daniel and Charles Houle in London in 1865,
        and Walsh Brothers Jewelers imported it to Australia on the Victorian
        Racing Club's behalf. The cup is 75.5 centimeters tall and is made of
        silver-gilt chased with gold leaf. It is an example of the Renaissance
        revival design popular in England in the middle of the 19th century.
        <br />
        <br />
        It can be argued that the 1867 Queen's Plate, crafted by Melbourne
        silversmith William Edwards, was intended to be exhibited as a Melbourne
        Cup because the protruding horse's heads closely resemble those depicted
        on that piece.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Melbourne Cup was won in 1868 by "Honest" John Tait, an immigrant to
        Australia in 1837, went into racing as a business and was one of the
        first people that went into horse racing as a serious enterprise and
        become substantially successful, as he was as a horse owner, trainer and
        punter. He had extensively bet on Glencoe, his backup horse, at
        favorable odds before scratching his more fancied champion, The Barb,
        who was the undisputed pre-race favorite. One of the first people to
        pursue horse racing as a serious economic enterprise was Tait. He was
        reportedly quite successful as a punter as well as an owner, trainer,
        and pundit. Tait is regarded as one of Australia's greatest racers and
        has even been dubbed the "Father of the Australian Turf" by some. Tait's
        excellent winning record includes four Melbourne Cups, four Victorian
        Derbys, two Queensland Derbys, four Australian Jockey Club Derbies, two
        Epsom Handicaps, two Sydney Cups, and three Victorian Racing Club
        Champion Stakes. Tait was inducted into the Australian Racing Hall of
        Fame in 2006.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Barb, a wonderfully proportioned black yearling known as the "Black
        Demon" for his fiery disposition after he threw from his rider before
        the start of his maiden race, won the Melbourne Cup in 1866. George Lee,
        the son of one of the area's first free settlers, William Lee, raised
        the Barb at Bathurst. According to some tales, the horse was taken while
        still a foal at foot by bushrangers, but when he developed lameness, he
        was freed and later given back to his owners. Even the horse's fiery
        disposition has been attributed to possible mistreatment by his captors
        at the time. As a yearling, George Lee sold John Tait, The Barb.
        <br />
        <br />
        With 16 victories from 23 races, including the Metropolitan Stakes, two
        Sydney Cups, the Australian Jockey Club Derby, and the 1866 Melbourne
        Cup, The Barb had a remarkable record. The Barb was the country's first
        legendary champion racehorse, and he dominated the period when
        Australian racing switched from being predominately amateur to
        predominately professional. Of all the horses honored by the Australian
        Racing Hall of Fame, The Barb was admitted first.
